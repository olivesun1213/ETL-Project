Original Data Sources: 
1.	Steam official website: https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=topsellers
2.	Top rated games on Steam: https://steamdb.info/stats/gameratings/

We used web scraping to extract the top sellers from the first data source and extracted ratings from the second source.The libraries we used are: Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Splinter, Time and tqdm(progress bar tracker for loops).
Both of the data are in HTML format.
